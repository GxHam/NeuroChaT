Look at calc_border_distance. Seems to fail for very large pixel values.
Don't crash on loading if there is no cut file. (Extension - don't crash, print error messages instead)
Show firing map plots in centimetres instead of in pixels, would also likely help with calc_border_distance.
Print a message if you try to set to a non existant unit number.
Set the open dir for files to self.path = Qt.Core.QFileInfo(excel_file).path() - write an open file function in ui and just update this.
Change Yloc and Xloc for centimetres
